Once your licence is issued, you will receive an email from the BizVibez team. You may then schedule a meeting with our Client Service Specialist and collect your documents at a convenient time.

    content: `### Can my local partner take control of my business?
Yes, but only if you are not structured correctly. At BizVibez we offer comprehensive advice on company structuring and can implement a few mechanisms to ensure you always remain in control of your business.

### What happens if my local partner passes away?
If your local partner is a natural person, then an heir will inherit the 51% share in your business. It is then up to that person if he or she wishes to continue in the same manner as nominee shareholder or if they wish to negotiate new terms or be more involved in the business. At BizVibez we offer a corporate nominee shareholder solution that can protect you in the event of the passing of a local partner.

### Can foreigners now own Mainland companies 100%?
Yes, in some cases this is possible. If interested, please contact BizVibez and we will see if we can do this for you.

Check this — [Looking for a local sponsor in Dubai?](https://www.bizbibez.com/looking-for-a-local-sponsor-in-dubai)

### What if I want to change my local partner?
BizVibez offers a market leading 30-day notice period without penalty if you wish for us to transfer the shares to a new partner while under our sponsorship. However, if you have a natural person as your local partner it is your responsibility to negotiate exit terms at the time of exit.

### Can my UAE mainland company buy property?
Yes, your mainland company can own both residential and commercial property in the UAE.

### If I have a 51% local partner, can I still fully control my business?
Yes, in some cases this is possible. If interested, please contact BizVibez and we will see if we can do this for you. You can also read more [here](https://www.BizVibez.com/fully-control-my-business-with-local-partner).

The first thing is that there is no single standard for business compliance services, so it’s important to make sure the service you choose is right for your business. Important questions to ask a potential compliance expert in Dubai should include: What services do you offer? Are you familiar with the laws and regulations in the UAE? How often do you update your clients on changes to the law? Do you have any case studies or success stories from previous clients? These questions will help you determine whether a particular compliance service is right for your business.",

Some examples of noncompliance with Dubai law are as follows: Operating without a valid trade licence, Not registering employees with the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE), Trading in banned goods or services, Failing to pay taxes. These are just a few examples. In the UAE banned goods could include things like alcohol and pork products, as well as weapons or drugs. It would be a shame if a business was in legal hot water for serving alcohol at a work reception or some ham sandwiches, but it could technically happen!

Alcohol, on the other hand, may still only be consumed in private homes and licensed public locations. In the UAE, to drink legally, a person must be at least 21 years old.

        description:
          "Economic Substance Regulations (ESR). The ESRs require companies operating in the UAE to preserve a strong UAE economic presence. This is to show that the financial status of the company is transparent and that off-shore accounts are not being abused. If your company earns income from any Relevant Activities, you must complete annual filing requirements. Otherwise, your company could face penalties for not complying with the law. “Relevant Activities” under this law include: Shipping, Insurance, Banking, Holding company, Intellectual property, Lease-finance, Investment fund managing, Distribution or servicing centre, Headquarters. Even if you call any of these activities by another name, if they serve the same function, they would still count as a Relevant Activity under the law. There is no minimum income threshold that is applicable to this law either, so individual UAE entities must all comply regardless of size. If your company conducts any of the Relevant Activities listed, it must file within six months before the end of the financial year on the Ministry of Finance’s (MoF) ESR portal. You’ll have to disclose which activities were conducted, income earned, and whether or not this income was taxed outside of the UAE. Companies with income from Relevant Activities must then prove that they have adequate economic substance in the UAE. To do this, you will have to satisfy the following Economic Substance Tests: Core Income Generating Activity Test, Directed and Managed Test, Adequacy Test. High-risk companies will be required to take enhanced Economic Substance Tests. This would companies that have work that includes intellectual property. The impacts of COVID-19 are also considered, including travel restrictions, but the facts should be carefully reviewed by companies and documentation should still reflect any changes made. If your company has earned income from Relevant Activities, it must file a report on the MoF online portal within 12 months of the end of the related financial year. During this time, your company will disclose a lot of information, such as: Whether Economic Substance Tests were completed, Details surrounding outsourced providers, Operations expenditure and number of full-time employees per Relevant Activity. Part of the reason this transparency is required is so that companies are not able to come up with overly-complex corporate arrangements to commit fraud, launder money, dodge taxes, or conceal wealth. When you have a strong economic presence in the UAE, this is showing clarity regarding your company’s financial status and allows the government to see that you’re not trying to hide your crucial assets. If your company conducts any of the Relevant Activities listed, it must file within six months before the end of the financial year on the Ministry of Finance’s ESR portal. Our team at BizVibez can help you check whether or not you’re meeting the Economic Substance Tests requirements. If you do meet the requirements, we can also help you file the ES Notification and ES Report.",

        description:
          "An Ultimate Beneficial Owner is a person that is the leading beneficiary when an establishment originates a transaction. Who comprises a UBO will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but it is usually defined as a specific person that has capital or voting privileges in the base entity. Generally, this is the person that owns or manages their own company. To identify UBOs, a bank will: Obtain and review the organisation’s credentials, Look at the chain of ownership, Determine who falls under the definition of UBO, Perform an AML or KYC check. To stay compliant with UBO regulations, you must register your UBOs. Article five of the UBO Regulations provides an outline for how you can determine who your UBO is (before the bank does). Your UBO needs to have the right to vote, own, or control with a minimum of 25% shareholding in the company. This is through direct or indirect means of ownership. They also may have the right to dismiss or appoint directors and managers within the company. If no one satisfies these requirements from your company, then the UBO is anyone else that exercises the main control over the company. If there is still no sure answer, the UBO would be the person in charge of senior management. Next, the company must have a register of nominee directors and managers. This register needs to be detailed about the individuals nominated and must contain information about acting on behalf of a third party’s instructions. The company must also have a register of shareholders. This will include the number of ownership interests that each shareholder in the company owns. It will also explain the voting rights of each party and the date that these rights were acquired. This information will help ensure that you’re selecting the correct UBO before you register. It also helps you stay compliant with the new laws, as well as the Commercial Companies Law. Regulators have been targeting money laundering and terrorism financing in the past couple of decades. Some defrauding groups use off-shore accounts to conceal their financial activity. Investigators trace any transactions that seem suspicious. They often lead to fake addresses, fictional PO boxes, or the addresses of people that have no involvement. Due to this, UBO regulations have started to appear across the world, including in the UAE. Every company has a specific risk with these issues, so it’s crucial to take measures that mitigate the risk! The UAE requires that Ultimate Beneficial Owners are registered so that transactions are transparent across all free zone and mainland operating companies. These regulations are in place to ensure that you know who you are doing business with, avoid criminal transactions, and stay within the confines of UAE law. By working with our team, you can register your UBO and complete the UBO declaration easily. We will offer our mandatory compliance services regarding the UAE’s law. This way, you can avoid fines or penalties from the government. Book a consultation with one of our professionals today so that you can get started!",

          "Before we dive into how to open a bank account in the United Arab Emirates, let’s take a minute to talk about the banking sector. The UAE has a banking system that’s regulated by a central bank. Apart from the central bank, there is a total of roughly 50 international and local banks scattered throughout the country. The banking system is considered to be fairly stable thanks to the banks’ liquidity buffers and resilient capital levels. Most banks in the UAE are funded by deposits. Their strong capital levels provide a large buffer that absorbs any losses. The UAE has four different types of banks. These types of banks include: Commercial banks, Investment banks, Industrial banks, Islamic banks. Islamic banks are a type of bank that has grown in popularity. In recent years, UAE banks have worked to expand their banking services to consumers using Islamic financial requirements. This is important for the many Islamic citizens living in the country. At the moment, there are 23 Islamic bank windows and 8 full-fledged Islamic banks in the nation. These institutions make up nearly 20% of the UAE’s banking sector. Aside from Islamic banks in the nation, the UAE banks also cater to foreigners and international consumers. They have adopted several international regulations and offer all their banking services in both Arabic and English. A few international regulations that UAE banks comply with include: International Accounting Standard, International Financial Reporting Standards, Capital Adequacy Regulations from the Basel III Regulations.",

          "If you’re planning to use your bank account to do business in the UAE, you’ll need to open a corporate bank account. The reason why you have to open a corporate account is that UAE law prohibits you from doing business with a personal account. Generally speaking, corporate accounts should be current accounts. The reason for this is so that they can process a large volume of transactions. Opening a current corporate account in the UAE usually takes between two and four weeks. When you go to open a corporate bank account, it’s important to note that you’ll need a few additional documents to do so. The exact documents may vary depending on your chosen bank and your type of company, but they usually include: Your company trade license, A certificate of your company’s registration, Share certificates, The company’s articles of association and memorandum, A letter from the board giving a company officer the power to open a corporate account, Visas and passports from all shareholders. With these documents in hand, you’ll be all set to open a bank account.",

The problem is, mail arrives thick and fast and it can be easily missed. Even with postal services, many businesses simply do not have the time to spend organising their mail delivery. This leaves you to wonder, what is the most convenient way for business owners to collect their mail? After all, business owners get burdened by an endless list of tasks to complete every day. Unfortunately, time is not always their ally. So it begs the question, why bother taking the time to organise mail delivery, lose time signing for it, and scramble to store it safely when you can have someone do it for you? There is an easier way. A way that can save you valuable time on your business and provide you with mail management you can consistently rely on. Read on for more information.",

          "The beauty of having your mail managed for you is that it saves you time, and as we know in business, time is money. Most businesses have mail coming in on a daily basis so organising delivery and collecting that mail can take a lot of time. What’s more, the mail that gets sorted needs safe storage. Unfortunately, messy desks or fast-paced work environments can stop this from happening. Of course, mail can get missed. That mail could contain important documents, letters, and information. If it does get missed, there’s a real chance this could turn into a big problem. To avoid this, you need someone who is reliable and consistent to collect your mail for you. Luckily, not only does BizVibez have a system set up for exactly that, but we also have a lot of experience. This includes managing small businesses’ mail, big businesses’ mail, and large organisations’ mail. With that kind of experience and expertise, it definitely speeds up the mail management process for you.",

          "One thing that many businesses are guilty of is spending too much time looking through old mail for important information. The problem with not having your mail organised is that it can actually be a massive pain and suck endless hours from your important business time. Each of your pieces of mail should be organised in an easy-to-manage fashion. For example, when new mail comes in, it should be divided into its own pile to prevent any potential mix-ups. Secretaries can help with this. However, offices can get cluttered and unless you have some kind of sorting system, mail can still take a while to find. Also, it’s only natural that humans make errors. So having different kinds of mail stored near each other can still cause issues. That kind of confusion can prove to be a serious problem.",

Following this, we will then very carefully organise your mail so it’s readily available for a swift collection. Something important to note here is that your business is completely your own.

While some of these challenges can be resolved through contract negotiations or with the help of friends and family, others are best handled by a team of legal professionals. When it comes to retaining a legal team in Dubai, there are a few key benefits you can expect. Increased Compliance: The legal landscape in Dubai is constantly changing. With a retained legal team, you always have someone monitoring local legislation. They can resolve any compliance issues that may arise. This can help your company avoid fines, penalties, or even the loss of its business license. Reduced Risks: One of the biggest concerns for companies operating in Dubai is avoiding risk. Businesses that do not have a retained legal team may be at risk of violating local laws and regulations. This can lead to costly lawsuits or even the loss of business rights in the United Arab Emirates. Diligence: A retained legal team will conduct due diligence on your behalf before you begin any new project or venture with another company in Dubai. This includes conducting a thorough background check on the other party and reviewing contracts for any red flags. Legal Advice: It’s hard to run a business without legal advice from time to time, but finding competent lawyers in Dubai can be difficult. When you retain a team of legal professionals, they will ensure that all your questions are answered promptly. Immediate Legal Representation: It doesn’t happen often but sometimes people need immediate legal representation. This is especially true for companies that operate in Dubai but are headquartered elsewhere around the world. A retained team of lawyers can ensure that your company’s interests are protected at all times, even when you’re not physically present. The above benefits will help protect your business from unnecessary risks and liabilities while also providing peace of mind.",

        description:
          "Before you decide on which outsourced receptionist services you’d like to use, you should know what BizVibez receptionists do in the first place. Compared to traditional receptionists you sit at a desk all day taking calls and answering messages, BizVibez receptionists do the same tasks but from the comfort of their own homes or offices. So, what do BizVibez receptionists do? BizVibez receptionists normally direct callers, provide information and deal with general business enquiries. They act in the same way as a traditional receptionist so your clients will never tell the difference. Even though they do the same job, you might be wondering how BizVibez receptionists work. For example, you might be asking the question, how can someone answer your company calls if they’re not in the same office? Or, how can you communicate with your BizVibez receptionist?",

That way, your BizVibez receptionist can give the caller the best customer service possible. Alternatively, you can also set up direct messaging. This could be a good option for start-up businesses that can’t afford a BizVibez receptionist 24/7. Plus, callers can still access the information they need on time.",

Rich from its vast oil and natural gas reserves, Dubai has successfully diversified its economy. With a stable government and access to huge populations in Asia, Africa, and Europe, Dubai is an attractive business location. Its zero-tax regime and 100% company profit repatriation in certain jurisdictions only add to its appeal. In 2019, the UAE government announced it would allow complete foreign ownership of companies in particular sectors and business zones across the country. Some of these sectors include hospitality, manufacturing and renewable energy. It’s worth noting that each jurisdiction within the UAE has its own rules relating to foreign-owned businesses. As such, if you decide to establish a business in one of the aforementioned sectors in a particular region, it is not guaranteed that these freedoms will apply to you. There are 60 different jurisdictions, just to complicate things! If your business does not fall into one of these designated sectors or zones, there is a range of other conditions you must meet to start a business. These conditions are not unachievable. There is, however, a mountain of paperwork involved. Plus, liaising with Emirati authorities can be complex. That’s where we can help. Our BizVibez process is simple. That’s why we’re the partner of choice for more entrepreneurs choosing to start a business in the UAE. Conditions aside, we help foreign investors continue to flock to the country. Why not join them?

If you’re eligible for a visa on arrival, you should take advantage of it. These visas will vary in length depending on the country in which your passport was issued. Eligible citizens must present a passport with no less than six months until expiry. If your passport has less than six months of validity, you must obtain a new passport before travelling to the UAE. If you are a passport holder of one of the following countries, you are eligible for a 30-day visa: Andorra, Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Kazakhstan, Macau, Malaysia, Mauritius, Monaco, New Zealand, The Republic of Ireland, San Marino, Singapore, Ukraine, The United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, The United States of America, Vatican City. Passport holders from the above countries can access a UAE visa on arrival free of charge. It’s also worth noting that this is a single-entry visa. Alternatively, if you are a passport holder of one of the following countries, you can access a 90-day, multiple-entry visa, free of charge: Argentina, Austria, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, The Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Kiribati, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, The Maldives, Malta, Montenegro, Nauru, The Netherlands, Norway, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, San Marino, Serbia, Seychelles, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Uruguay. If you’re a Mexican citizen, you can access a 180-day, multiple-entry visa on arrival. To be eligible, you must present plane tickets, health insurance and a hotel reservation. As mentioned above, you must also have at least six months of validity left on your passport to apply. The rules are slightly different for Indian passport holders. If that’s you, you can only access a 14-day visa on arrival if you can present one of the following: A USA-issued visit visa valid for at least six months; A USA-issued green card valid for at least six months; or Evidence of holding a UK or EU residence. This visa will set you back AED 120, which equates to about USD 33.

However, you’ll need a passport with no less than three months until expiry. To apply for a prearranged visa, you will need: A colour copy of your passport; A colour photograph of yourself; An application form; A copy of your plane ticket. A 48-hour and 96-hour non-extendable visa will set you back USD 10 and 30 respectively. Alternatively a single entry, short-term tourist visa will cost USD 90. This option is extendable. However, doing so will set you back USD 230. You could also apply for a short-term, multiple-entry visa for USD 175. This will last you 30 days and can also be extended for the cost of USD 230. Otherwise, if you’re looking to stay in the UAE for an extended period of time, you could apply for a long-term tourist visa. Single-entry and multiple-entry visas, allowing you to stay in the country for 90 days, will set you back USD 190 and 460, respectively. These visas can also be extended for an additional USD 230.

Both foreign employees and foreign business owners can apply. In theory, this visa is open to passport holders from all countries. Prior to the introduction of this visa program, you would have needed to be sponsored by an Emirati national or obtain work in the UAE to spend such an extended time in the country. This visa removes those barriers, opening up the UAE to a much larger population of foreign workers. Unfortunately, this visa program does not allow you to establish a business in the UAE. As such, if your goal is to establish a business in the country, the one-year remote working visa may not be for you. However, if you want an extended taste of life in the UAE prior to making a decision about whether to locate your business there, this visa could be a good option. Spending a year building business relationships while working your day job remotely may not be such a bad idea. In fact, it could be a great start to your new life as an entrepreneur in the UAE. The remote-working visa application will set you back USD 287. There are other costs involved, including UAE health insurance and ID fees. These costs may vary. In total, however, you are likely to spend upwards of USD 600. To apply for this visa, you’ll need a passport with no less than six months validity and UAE health insurance. Employees will also need to present the following: Proof of employment; A work contract no shorter than a year; Proof of a salary no less than USD 5,000/month; Three months bank statements. Business owners will also need to present the following: Proof of business ownership of no less than one year; An average monthly income of no less than USD 5000/month; Three months bank statements.",

You don’t have to imagine. That’s what’s on offer in the United Arab Emirates. The only catch is that to stay in the country long-term you’ll need a UAE Golden Visa.\n\nWhat’s a Golden Visa in the UAE?\nWe’ve prepared this guide to answer all your questions about the United Arab Emirate’s prestigious Golden Visa.

          "Unlike many other international Visa programs, the United Arab Emirates’ unique Golden Visa program allows eligible individuals permanent residence with a 10 year visa. However, it also comes with a range of attractive privileges that most typical residence visa programs would not offer.\n\nLaunched in 2019, the famous Golden Visa program functioned as a bid to attract and retain foreign talent with permanent residence in a tax-friendly environment. The program also aimed to foster business development to boost the UAE’s economy.\n\nIt worked.\n\nBy late 2021, 44,000 Dubai residents had secured long-term residency through the Golden Visa. The program may also form part of the reason the UAE fared so well through the pandemic. The program has certainly bolstered the UAE’s global standing as an attractive place to live, work and kickstart new businesses.\n\nThe Golden Visa program specifically aims to attract budding entrepreneurs, investors and talented individuals in specific fields. Medical staff, engineers, researchers and even high-achieving university students can be eligible for the program.\n\nGolden Visa Residency is applicable for ten years. In some situations, the visas can also be renewed automatically – a handy feature for those who struggle with the endless monotony of bureaucracy. Features like this prove that the UAE government wants to make the visa application process simple. Anyone who’s ever applied for a foreign visa will know how painful these processes can sometimes be.",

                Golden Visa Program: The Gold Standard of Long-Term Residence
                Visas
              </h2>
              <p className=" text-gray-600 mb-4">
                The UAE government has designed the Golden Visa program to
                attract top talent from around the globe. With benefits like
                year-round sunshine, ultra-modern infrastructure, and stunning
                beaches, it’s an appealing option for many. However, the visa's
                real perks are what make it stand out.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">
                1) You Don’t Need a Local Sponsor
              </h3>
              <p className=" text-gray-600 mb-2">
                Golden Visa holders do not need to obtain a local sponsor to
                live, study, or work in the UAE.
              </p>
              <p className=" text-gray-600 mb-6">
                For those unfamiliar with common residency processes, this may
                not seem significant. But for those who are, securing a local
                sponsor can be time-consuming and complex, especially if you're
                not employed by a local company or don’t know any nationals. By
                removing the need for a national sponsor, the Golden Visa
                simplifies the residency process, making it even more
                attractive.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">
                2) You Can Own 100% of Your Business
              </h4>
              <p className=" text-gray-600 mb-2">
                Another major benefit of the Golden Visa is that holders can own
                100% of a business in the UAE.
              </p>
              <p className=" text-gray-600 mb-6">
                This is a huge advantage. Previously, foreigners starting a
                business in the UAE needed to partner with an Emirati national,
                who would own a percentage of the company. While there were
                exceptions for certain industries and zones, the Golden Visa
                removes these barriers for eligible foreign entrepreneurs,
                business owners, and investors.
              </p>

              <h5 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">
                3) You Can Add Other People to Your Visa
              </h5>
              <p className=" text-gray-600 mb-2">
                If you secure a Golden Visa, you don’t need to go through the
                hassle of obtaining separate visas for your family members or
                key business associates. You can add your family members,
                business partners, or associates to your visa, subject to
                certain conditions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                If you have a partner or children travelling with you to the
                UAE, this feature can save you a lot of paperwork and help
                prevent family separation.
              </p>

              <h5 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">
                4) You Can Travel Freely to and from the UAE
              </h5>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                Golden Visa holders can travel to and from the UAE as many times
                as they like. In this regard, holding a Golden Visa is like
                being a UAE citizen. You can visit friends and family back home
                or schedule as many overseas business meetings as you want.
                There are no limits — you're free to come and go!
              </p>

                Additional Benefits for Golden Visa Holders in Different

              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                The Golden Visa programs across different Emirates offer various
                benefits to you and your family members in different sectors.
                When considering applying for citizenship or permanent
                residency, it's important to explore all the visa options

In Dubai, all business types must file their financial statements with the Department of Economic Development (DED) regardless of their size. The Department of Economic Development (DED) is also responsible for issuing licenses and regulating all economic activities in Dubai. There are several different types of businesses that can be set up in Dubai, and the accounting and tax requirements will vary depending on the type. In any case, filing your taxes and keeping your books in order is a complex process, and it’s important to have an expert on your side.

        description:
          "A lot of people are curious about the differences in taxes between Dubai and other countries, like the US. In the UAE there is no personal income tax, but businesses must pay a corporate tax rate of 24%. This is significantly lower than the corporate tax rates in other countries, such as the US (35%) but slightly higher than the UK (21%). However, there are other taxes that businesses must pay in Dubai, such as the Zakat tax which is a religious tithe that all Muslims must pay. The Zakat tax is usually around two and a half percent of a company’s annual profits. Various other taxes may apply, depending on the business type and location. It’s important to consult with a PR Services company that can guide you on making the most of the tax infrastructure in Dubai. For example, the Dubai Free Zone offers many tax exemptions for businesses located there. For example: 100% exemption from corporate tax for the first five years, 50% exemption from corporate tax for the next five years, 100% exemption from Zakat tax, No import duties on capital goods and raw materials. If that sounds intriguing to you, it probably should! There are a host of benefits to setting up a business at a free zone in Dubai.

          "The UAE has its own set of GAAP accounting principles. The International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) is in charge of maintaining these standards. The GAAP principles apply to all the UAE government entities and state-owned companies. The accounting standards of the UAE are based on the following principles: Income is recognised when it is realised or realisable. Expenses are recognised when they are incurred. Revenue is recognised when it is earned. You should measure assets and liabilities at fair value, except for financial instruments and leases. These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rates. Running your own business in Dubai is a fun challenge. However, it can also be a struggle when it comes to accounting and bookkeeping. Here are five policies you need to follow: Record Keeping Policy. Under the UAE Federal Law, you should keep your financial records and statements. You must ensure those records are intact for at least five years. The Ministry of Finance recommends keeping records for ten years to prove tax compliance. Cash Receipts. Transactions of up to AED 1,000 need evidence supported by a receipt. Receipts must be in the name of the business. They must include the date of issue, signature of the person issuing the receipt, and recipient. You must also indicate the amount and nature of the transaction. The details are essential for proof of transactions. They also improve accounting accuracy. Bank Transactions. All bank transactions need the support of a bank statement. The statement must include the date of the transaction and the name and address of the business receiving the funds. You also need to include the amount and nature of the transaction. Companies can keep an electronic record of the statements. Keeping these records helps in accurately preparing an annual budget and profit and loss accounts. VAT Returns. Businesses operating in UAE must comply with Value Added Tax (VAT) regime, effected on January 1st 2018. The new tax applies to all companies in UAE, whether your services are local or outside UAE. Businesses are required to register for VAT if they meet the eligibility criteria. Taxes in Dubai can be a complex matter. As such, your business should adopt a VAT Return Policy that makes sense. It should be in line with industry best practices. Other Supporting Documents. Other supporting documents include invoices, credit notes and contracts. Also, include bank statements for businesses that are not registered for VAT. The above documents should be in their original form. Copies of the documents are not acceptable.",

        title: "How to Keep Your Business Accounting Records in Order in Dubai",
        description:
          "Many small businesses attempt to do their books. This is common when a firm doesn’t want to spend money on accounting firms. Business owners also think they can keep things more “in-house.” However, this often leads to a lot of stress and time wasted. Accounting is complex and a full-time job in itself. If you are running a business, you likely already have enough on your plate. Instead of doing everything by yourself, consider the following options: Hiring Accounting Staff. This involves getting an in-house permanent accounting employee. Depending on your company’s size, you can hire one or a team of accountants. The hiring process involves posting the job offer on your website or job websites. You interview several candidates until you find the perfect fit. Some of the qualifications you should look for include experience in reconciliation, monitoring/recording accounts payables and accounts receivables transactions, basic bookkeeping and financial reporting. If you are lucky to find a reliable accounting staff member, they can handle all accounting operations. Alternatively, you can use outsourced accounting services in the UAE. Outsourcing Accounting Services. Accounting outsourcing is the transfer of accounting functions to third party accounting firms. This includes services like bookkeeping, tax preparation and financial statement preparation. You can outsource these services to an independent professional firm that specialises in that particular industry. Outsourced accounting services take over the day-to-day tasks of your accounting department. You can choose to outsource all accounting operations or some hectic ones. Here are some of the most popular outsourced accounting services: Payroll. Payroll is one of the top reasons why companies outsource their accounting. Payroll is complex and requires specialised knowledge and expertise. Accounts Payable. This is the department that pays your bills. The person who handles accounts payable must be very detail-oriented and knowledgeable about tax laws. Accounts Receivable. This department is responsible for collecting money from your customers. If your business offers its services and products on credit, you need agile management of these records. Poor management of accounts receivable can run your business into bankruptcy. Bookkeeping. Bookkeeping is the process of recording your financial transactions. This can be done manually or electronically. When dealing with BizVibez accounting companies, you have to do it electronically. Budgeting. Budgeting is the process of planning your finances. It involves determining how much money you will make and how much you will spend. Tax Accounting. Tax accounting is the process of preparing tax returns for your business. The firm will also calculate income taxes payable by your business. Tax accounting is different from financial accounting. You are better off having an expert who does both of these accounting tasks. A company may outsource their accounting because they don’t have the staff to handle these tasks. Whatever the reason, it can be a more cost-effective alternative than hiring permanent employees.",

Stay Focused on Your Business. Bookkeeping is one of the most critical aspects of an organisation. It is the documentation of financial transactions and records. Accounting and bookkeeping are tedious and complex jobs. There are several reasons behind this complexity. The accountant has many responsibilities to fulfil. They need to ensure all transactions are documented and accounted for. This can be overwhelming when the company has a lot of transactions taking place. There are many types of documents that need to be maintained. These include cash receipts, bank statements, and cheque stubs. The accountant needs to ensure that all these documents are stored safely, and the information is easily accessible. It will require more than 60 hours per week to manage your accounting. This draws your attention from other business operations like customer service, partnerships, and others. Outsourcing your accounting operations frees up time for other operations. It allows you to focus on important business operations. Meet Statutory Requirements and Regulations. Have you ever opened your mail to find a letter from the taxman? The reason behind this letter is that you may not have filed your taxes. The UAE has introduced VAT in 2018 and is planning to introduce corporate tax in 2023. It is best to make sure your company’s books are in order and updated to prepare for any tax audit or reporting requirements.

They keep your records as per the set legal standards and advise on minimising legal risks. Address Labor Shortage Problems. Talent is the lifeblood of a successful company. You need professionals to meet your accounting needs. Businesses in the UAE have been facing a shortage of skilled workers for years. Dubai is now specifically facing a shortage of accounting staff. The problem stems from the increased competition for employees. Employers have a hard time finding the best candidates for their vacancies. When they do, it’s difficult to retain them. Despite government policies to help retain accounting staff, it continues to be hard. For instance, the government requires an accountant to work for at least two years before they can resign. If he quits before that time, he pays back the salary and benefits. Outsourcing helps your company avoid labour shortage and retention problems. You have access to competent accountants beyond Dubai.

For example, in Abu Dhabi, the citizens are covered under the Thiga program, which gives them full access to various public and private healthcare providers. The UAE has an all-inclusive government-funded health service that delivers high-quality standards of care in both public and private sectors. These services are available for free or subsidised for UAE nationals. However, ex-pats and any other non-resident have to pay to access the high standards of care. If you are an employee in the UAE, your employer is responsible for ensuring you can access quality healthcare. Additionally, all employers, including employers of ex-pats in the UAE, cannot deduct the salary of their employees to provide them with good medical coverage. Also, sponsors have to provide health insurance for their dependents. In Dubai, the Health Insurance law requires all residents to have valid insurance coverage that exceeds or meets the minimum requirement laid out by the Dubai Health Authority (DHA). UAE nationals in Dubai can access Saada, which provides health insurance coverage to all citizens who are not getting help from government health programs in Dubai. Citizens who use Saada cab access treatment in various private healthcare providers and DHA health facilities. The citizens can also opt out of other private healthcare coverage and join the government scheme.",

Employers and sponsors in Abu Dhabi need to provide health insurance coverage for their employees and their dependents. This includes one spouse and up to three children under 18 years.

Therefore before choosing an insurer, it is vital to know how they work, how to claim, treatment included in your coverage, how to pay, and more. Check out the UAE Insurance Authority for a list of all approved and registered insurance providers. Ensure you get health coverage from a valid insurance company.

## How to start a business in Dubai — The Company Formation Process

### <a id="choose-an-industry" class="font-semibold text-xl">1. Choose an industry</a>

There are many industries in the UAE and plenty of opportunities for innovation. You might be tempted to jump ahead to the actual setup process straight away, however, **we recommend that you decide on the nature of your business up front**.


For example, certain free zone locations cater to specific activities or industries, such as media, finance or tech. Let’s take a look at Dubai Media City. As its name suggests, it is a free zone dedicated to media companies, or businesses operating media-related activities. Dubai Media City is home to globally renowned media companies, such as BBC, CNN and Thomson Reuters. Another example is Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), where large global financial services companies like Credit Suisse AG, Goldman Sachs International and Morgan Stanley have offices.

Over the years, however, a number of sector-specific free zones have started to welcome general business activities, and not just the ones they are intended for.

Restrictions aside, there are other reasons why you may want to set up in close proximity to businesses in the same sector as you. Look at transport links too. If your business relies heavily on import and export, you should consider one of the free zones situated near an airport or port.

There are numerous business sectors thriving in the UAE. In 2022 and beyond, the commitment to diversifying beyond the oil economy means that new businesses that contribute to this vision will be looked upon favorably.

### <a id="choose-a-location">2. Choose a location</a>

Having settled on an industry, your next big decision is whether to launch in the mainland or in a free zone. If you opt to set up in a free zone, you’ll benefit from:

- 0% corporate and personal tax
- 100% company ownership
- 100% repatriation of capital and profits
- No currency restrictions, and
- 100% import and export tax exemption

However, if you wish to trade directly with the local market in the UAE, you’ll need to work with a mainland company who will charge a fee.

On the other hand, if you choose to set up in the mainland, you are free to trade directly with the local and international markets.

### <a id="choose-your-company-name">3. Choose your company name</a>

The UAE has some strict naming conventions, so before you commit to a company name, make sure it is legally acceptable.

Any names that include offensive language are forbidden, as are any company names that refer to Allah, Him or any other religious, sectarian or political groups such as the FBI or Mafia. If you choose to name your business after a person, that person must be a partner or owner of the company and their full name must be used — no initials or abbreviations.

*For a full rundown of how to choose a company name, visit this guide.*

### <a id="apply-for-a-licence">4. Apply for a licence</a>

Once your application has been processed, the government/Freezones will issue you with your company licence. Regardless of setup location, you’ll usually only require a few standard documents: a completed application form, shareholder passport copies and the like. Some free zones may also require you to provide a business plan.

### <a id="open-a-bank-account">5. Open a bank account</a>

Once your paperwork has been returned, you will have all the documentation you need to open your corporate bank account. The UAE is home to many banks, both local and international, including:

- Mashreq bank 
- Dubai Islamic bank 
- Emirates NBD 
- First Abu Dhabi Bank 
- Habib bank Zurich 
- Misr bank 
- Ajman Bank 
- Al Hilal bank 
- City bank 
- Commercial bank Dubai CBD
- Emirates Islamic bank 
- Bank of Sharjah 
- Invest bank 
- National bank of Fujairah 
- Rak bank 
- United Arab bank 
- Abu Dhabi Islamic bank ADIB 
- ADCB 
- Standard chartered
- HSBC 
- Barclays.

There are also global names such as HSBC, Citibank and Barclays. Choosing the one that’s right for you will depend on your specific requirements.

You will need a bank account before you can begin trading in the UAE.

<br/>

### <a id="apply-for-a-visa">6. Apply for a visa</a>

Congratulations on making it this far! Applying for a visa is the final step on how to start a business in Dubai. As well as applying for your own visa, many free zones allow you to put in applications for staff and dependants. The exact number you can submit will depend on which free zone you choose to set up in.

If you are looking to obtain visas for a spouse, child, maid or driver, it is best to seek expert advice to ensure that, firstly, it is possible to do so in your chosen free zone, and secondly, that both you and anyone you are hoping to sponsor for a visa meet all of the entry criteria.

Assuming that this all checks out, the process is made up of four simple stages:

- Entry permit
- Status adjustment
- Medical fitness test
- Emirates ID registration and visa stamping

*There is no limit to the number of visas a mainland company can apply for, whereas free zone companies will have some restrictions, which vary from one free zone to another.*

That's it! With these eight steps completed, you're ready to start your business in Dubai!


## Let's do business!

Once you have completed these steps, you will be ready to start trading. Compared to other parts of the world, setting up a company in the UAE is very straightforward — ranked 16th in the world in the latest World Bank Ease of Doing Business rankings.

This guide will cover the process of acquiring your Trade License in Dubai, including costs, renewals, and benefits.

A Dubai Trade License, also known as a business license, is a document issued by the Department of Economic Development authorising a company to conduct specific activities within the UAE. This license is essential for any entity involved in importing and exporting goods, as well as engaging in various commercial activities.

General trading licenses in Dubai permit a business to engage in multiple trade activities under a single license. These licenses are versatile, allowing companies to operate in diverse sectors without needing multiple licenses.

## What Are the Types of Trade Licenses in Dubai?

In Dubai, Trade Licenses vary depending on the nature of the business. There are four primary types of licenses issued by the Department of Economic Development (DED):

- **Professional License**
  - This is for individuals or companies offering professional services, such as consultants, lawyers, and accountants.
  
- **Commercial License**
  - A Commercial License is required for companies engaged in buying or selling goods. Activities under this category include various forms of trading, either wholesale or retail.
  
- **Industrial License**
  - An Industrial License is necessary for businesses involved in manufacturing or any industrial activity, including the production, segregation, and fabrication of products.
  
- **General Trading License**
  - A General Trading License allows a business to trade in a wider range of activities and gives the freedom to trade virtually any goods.
  
- **E-Commerce License**
  - An e-Commerce License is specifically designed for businesses that sell goods or services online. It is crucial for companies operating via electronic networks or various digital means.

## What is a Free Zone, Offshore, and Mainland License?

The type of trade license you require also depends on where you plan to establish your business in Dubai. See the following licenses below:

- **Mainland License**
  - A Mainland License is necessary for businesses operating within the Dubai mainland. These companies can trade anywhere in the UAE and directly with the local market but require approvals from various government entities. The license is issued by the DED.

- **Free Zone License**
  - A Free Zone License, issued by the authority governing a specific Free Zone, permits companies to operate within the confines of that zone. These licenses offer benefits like full foreign ownership and tax exemptions but usually restrict companies to business within the free zone or internationally.

- **Offshore License**
  - An Offshore License is used to set up an offshore company, which is mainly used for international business and cannot trade within the UAE. This setup offers confidentiality and tax advantages but does not allow for physical office space in the UAE.

By understanding these distinctions, businesses can better navigate the regulatory environment in Dubai and choose the appropriate license and location to meet their operational needs.

## Benefits of Getting a Trade License in Dubai

Obtaining a Trade License in Dubai is not only essential for legal compliance and ensuring operational readiness, but it offers numerous advantages that can significantly enhance your business operations and potential for growth. Some of the key benefits include:

Even better, there are very few trade restrictions in Dubai. As long as your products are registered under a general trading license, you won’t have to worry about restrictions.

- **Improve Credibility**
  - Companies that adhere to the legal requirements in Dubai are seen as more trustworthy by customers. Holding a Trade License increases your business’s exposure and credibility in both local and international markets.
